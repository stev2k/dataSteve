I imagine it&#8217;s a relatively common problem, you have some files you would like to store in a database perhaps arriving on a regular basis, but you don&#8217;t want to manually process them and you don&#8217;t have the skills to write your own app to help you. In this blog I will show you one way of automating data import into SQL Server without code.

### Scoping out the solution

The first thing I do whenever I am scoping out a solution like this is make a list of the basic features the new solution will need:

We will need the following kinds of things:

  * We will need to accept the delivery of files from some other system
  * We will somewhere to store the CSV files on arrival
  * We will need to transform the CSV data from the files into a relational format
  * We will need to store the relational data in a database.
